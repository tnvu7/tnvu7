- 👋 Welcome to my Github! I’m Natalie Vu, currently a 3rd-year Software Developer student at Seneca College.
- 💞️ I have a passion for coding websites, mobile application, and doing UI/UX design.
- 👀 Currently, I’m looking for Summer 2022 Co-op/Internship opportunities.
- 🖥️ Please check out my repositories for websites, mobile applications, and some back-end projects!
- 🎾 In my free time, I like to do live my artsy side by playing piano, guitar, write songs, and do acrylic paintings. My favourite thing to do is playing sports, especially tennis and ping pong. They help me to stay healthy physically and mentally as well as be more productive towards my work.
- 📧 Feel free to reach me through my email: vuthunga2001@gmail.com
